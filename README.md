## Introduction

**ðŸ“¢ This repository contains data on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in New York City (NYC). The Health Department classifies the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC as the date of the first laboratory-confirmed case, February 29, 2020.**
  
The purpose of this project is to introduce a useful online interactive dashboard that visualize and follow confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. The dashboard illustrates the counts of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. This dashboard is user-friendly and is built in open-source R software (Shiny in particular); ensuring a high sense of transparency and reproducibility.
